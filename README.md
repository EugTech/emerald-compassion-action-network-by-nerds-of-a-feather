Our platform connects organizations needing volunteers, and volunteers willing to help. Moreover, having a common platform allows organizations joins hands and work on projects concerning the society. 

For example, Faith and Humanity organizations and Non-profit organizations can find projects related to Homelessness Aid, and address this concern together.

An admin of the Organization can add Users as part of the Organization and give them admin/not_admin roles.
